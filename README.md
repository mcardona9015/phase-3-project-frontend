### Functionality
After entering their name to start the game, a player can see their past game stats, view and select from the currently available game boards. 
When the player clicks on a game board they are taken to the main game page where they must use the arrow keys to move through the maze.
The goal is to collect as many coins as they can as quickly as possible without moving into a bomb square or its GAME OVER!

### Getting Started
1. Fork and clone this frontend repo and its accompanying backend onto your local machine
2. While in the backend directory, run `bundle install` in the terminal to ensure all necessary gems are installed
3. In the terminal run `rails db:seed` to seed the database 
4. Run `rails s` to start up a server listening on localhost:3000
5. Finally, open `index.html` in browser to play the game

### Next Steps
In subsequent versions of this app, we will create a wider selection of game play boards.
Feedback and contributions are welcomed.

### Collaborators
This project was created as Michael Cardona and Lauren Gifford's Mod 3 Project at the Flatiron School.
